# CLPics

Speed up browsing on Craigslist with search result previews.

Features image previews, text previews, and map previews, all with settings to get things working just-so.

# Installation

* Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (FF) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (Chrome)
* Go to the [raw view of `clpics.user.js`](https://github.com/eternicode/clpics/raw/master/clpics.user.js)
* The extension will then take over and prompt you to install the userscript

# Settings

Settings can be accessed by clicking the "[ clpics ]" link at the top-right of any craigslist page.
Settings are saved as they are changed, but most will not take effect until you reload the page.

If you previously used the CL Pics firefox addon, you can export your settings from the extension and import them into the userscript.
